# employee-tracker

## Description
The motive behind this project was to create a content management system to keep track of employees. It will save the user a ton of time organizing departments, employees, salaries, etc. I learned how to create databases using mysql2, created a connection from the database to the server, create queries to display, add, and update information onto database.
